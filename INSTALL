SNMP::Multi INSTALL

PREREQUISTIES

1. Install UCD SNMP by hand.

   UCD SNMP is not the Net::SNMP found on CPAN.
   In fact, it's not on CPAN at all (as of Jan 2002).
   Get it from http://www.net-snmp.org/.

      *** IMPORTANT ***

   By default, the SNMP perl modules are not installed.  
   The SNMP INSTALL file will help you with them.

2. Memoize is also required. CPAN.pm and MakeMaker
   ought to install it automatically for you.


INSTALL

Install SNMP::Multi just like any other CPAN module:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   
   # as root
   umask 002
   make install
